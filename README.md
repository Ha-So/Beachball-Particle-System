# Beachball-Particle-System
Utilizing OpenCL and OpenGL a 3D dynamic particle system was developed that employed aspects of parallel programming maximizing performance from the CPU and GPU.

Note - Additional libraries and files will need to be downloaded to succesfully run this system.

Aerial view over time as the particles move, collide and change into dynamically determined colors and patterns.
